# Competition over data: how does data purchase affect users?

This repository provides an implementation of the paper *[Competition over data: how does data purchase affect users?](https://openreview.net/forum?id=63sJsCmq6Q)* accepted at [Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)](https://www.jmlr.org/tmlr/). In this paper, we empirically show that the overall performance of a machine learning predictor improves when predictors can actively query additional labeled data. Suprisingly, however, the quality that users experience---i.e., the accuracy of the predictor selected by each user---can decrease even as the individual predictors get better.
